## About

This workshop provides 10 tips for making you python code more pythonic and faster.
The changes suggested should not impact results, but will make your code easier
to maintain and in many cases make it run faster.  Don't try to fix everything
at once, just learn a few of the anti-patterns and return to the notebook to
remember how to fix them.

Attendees should have some familiarity with Python.
